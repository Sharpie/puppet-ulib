Puppet ULIB
===========
_UnStandard library of useful Puppet functions_

This module contains a collection of functions designed to make working with
collections of data (Arrays and Hashes) easier inside Puppet Manifests. This
module uses the Puppet 4 function interface introduced in Puppet 3.6.0 and
available when the future parser is being used.

_In the future, this module may depend on Puppet 4.0._

The name `ulib` is short for `unstdlib` and is a nod
[underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) which inspired most the functionality
provided by this module.
